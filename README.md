# the shrine, 21st century edition

But why?

Well, to:

- [x] save the [original shrine](http://theshrine.de) from becoming history due to technical advancements.
- [x] allow everyone to contribute to the project.
- [x] keep the authentic design (for now), but make it usable on small screens.
- [x] allow it to be used offline.

## Adding a groove

Make sure it's freely usable.
Lower the volume by roughly 11dB. 

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project

```
